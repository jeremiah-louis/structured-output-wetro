        {
            "explanation": "Start with the equation 8x + 7 = -23.",
            "output": "8x + 7 = -23"
        },
        {
            "explanation": "Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate the term with x on one side of the equation. This helps us get closer to solving for x.",
            "output": "8x + 7 - 7 = -23 - 7"
        },
        {
            "explanation": "Simplify both sides of the equation. On the left side, the +7 and -7 cancel each other out, leaving us with 8x. On the right side, -23 - 7 equals -30.",
            "output": "8x = -30"
        },
        {
            "explanation": "Divide both sides of the equation by 8 to solve for x. This step isolates x by itself on one side of the equation.",
            "output": "x = -30 / 8"
        },
        {
            "explanation": "Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. Thus, -30 divided by 2 is -15, and 8 divided by 2 is 4.",
            "output": "x = -15/4"
        }
